# @kinematic-lab/vscode-monorepo-extension <!-- omit in toc -->

Extension for working with mono-repositories in Visual Studio Code.

<br />

## Disclaimer

The extension have been purposfully built to work with `@kinematic-lab`'s respositories.
It has therefore not been exhaustively tested against other mono-repositories, and errors may occur. If you want to use the extension, and this happens, feel free to create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/kinematic-lab/vscode-monorepo-extension), and I'll look into it.
